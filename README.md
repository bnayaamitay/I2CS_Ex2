* Basic Object-Oriented Programming & 2D Maze Algorithms

This assignment introduces the use of OOP via a set of algorithms on 2D arrays representing a maze or an image. The main algorithms are based on Breadth-First Search (BFS): shortest path, connected components, and fill. The main class (Map) is defined by a detailed interface (Map2D),  testing.
